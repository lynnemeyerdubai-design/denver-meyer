**Heading:** What I do.

### 01 — Retail Design
I design retail environments that translate brand identity into powerful physical experiences. Over the past 25+ years, I have worked across flagship stores, luxury boutiques, concessions, and multi-site rollouts — shaping spaces that elevate brand presence while driving commercial performance.

My approach balances aesthetic refinement with operational intelligence. I consider customer flow, zoning, merchandising logic, lighting strategy, and material selection to ensure each space functions as effectively as it looks.

From initial concept through execution, I ensure the retail environment reflects brand standards while adapting intelligently to local context, site constraints, and commercial objectives.

### 02 — Commercial Interior Design
I develop commercial interior environments that merge brand narrative with practical functionality. My work spans corporate, retail, and customer-facing commercial spaces where design must support both brand perception and day-to-day operations.

With extensive experience coordinating across stakeholders — from clients and architects to contractors and fabricators — I ensure that design intent is preserved throughout implementation.

Every project is approached with clarity, precision, and commercial awareness, ensuring environments are not only visually compelling but operationally sustainable.

### 03 — Design Conceptualisation
Strong outcomes begin with clear, strategic concepts. I develop design frameworks that translate business objectives into spatial and visual direction.

This includes mood boards, material palettes, spatial hierarchy, fixture strategy, and experiential flow — ensuring that early creative thinking is grounded in feasibility and execution.

My conceptual work provides a clear roadmap for stakeholders, aligning creative ambition with commercial reality before projects move into technical stages.

### 04 — 2D Technical Documentation
I produce detailed technical drawing packages required for accurate construction and fit-out. These include layout plans, elevations, joinery details, sections, and specification documentation.

Precision at this stage is critical. My documentation ensures contractors, suppliers, and production teams have complete clarity — reducing risk, preventing costly revisions, and safeguarding design integrity.

With decades of experience in retail fit-outs and commercial installations, I understand how documentation directly impacts build efficiency and final outcomes.

### 05 — 3D Visualisation
I create refined 3D visualisations that communicate spatial intent with clarity and confidence. These renderings allow clients and stakeholders to fully understand scale, materials, lighting, and brand presence before construction begins.

Visualisation is not simply presentation — it is a decision-making tool. My work enables alignment, reduces uncertainty, and strengthens project approval processes.

By combining conceptual clarity with technical understanding, I ensure visuals accurately represent what will ultimately be delivered.

### 06 — Project Management
I oversee projects from initial concept through to final delivery, ensuring alignment across creative, technical, and commercial priorities.

My role extends beyond design — I coordinate timelines, manage stakeholders, review site execution, and maintain quality standards throughout the build process.

With extensive experience in complex retail and commercial environments, I bring structure, accountability, and calm leadership to every engagement — ensuring projects are delivered efficiently and to the highest professional standard.
