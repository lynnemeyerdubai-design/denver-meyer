**Heading:** What I do.

### 01 — Retail Design
I design retail environments that translate brand identity into powerful physical experiences. My work spans flagship stores, luxury boutiques, concessions, and multi-location rollouts where spatial design must strengthen brand presence while supporting commercial performance.

With over 25 years of experience, I ensure each environment balances visual impact with operational logic — from concept through execution — delivering spaces that are both compelling and commercially effective.

### 02 — Commercial Interior Design
I develop commercial interiors that align brand identity with functional, high-performing environments. My experience includes retail, corporate, and customer-facing spaces where design must communicate professionalism and support real-world operations.

I work closely with clients and delivery teams to ensure clarity, buildability, and consistency — creating environments that reinforce brand credibility while remaining practical and durable.

### 03 — Design Conceptualisation
I create clear, strategically grounded design concepts that establish a strong foundation for execution. Each concept translates brand positioning and commercial objectives into spatial direction that can be confidently delivered.

This early clarity aligns stakeholders, reduces risk, and ensures the final outcome remains consistent with the original design intent.

### 04 — 2D Technical Documentation
I produce precise technical drawing packages required for fabrication and construction, including layouts, elevations, sections, and detailed joinery drawings.

My documentation ensures contractors can execute efficiently and accurately, protecting design integrity while minimising delays and costly revisions.

### 05 — 3D Visualisation
I create high-quality 3D visualisations that allow clients and stakeholders to fully understand spatial intent before construction begins.

This improves decision-making, strengthens alignment, and ensures confidence in the final design outcome.

### 06 — Project Management
I manage projects from concept through completion, coordinating clients, consultants, contractors, and suppliers to ensure smooth delivery.

This structured oversight protects design intent, maintains quality standards, and ensures projects are delivered professionally and efficiently.
